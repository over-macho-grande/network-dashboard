  <h2>AI Assistant (Coming Soon)</h2>
  <p>
    This page will host an AI interface that can answer questions about alerts,
    devices, performance, and documentation once it’s connected to Wazuh, LNMS,
    and other data sources.
  </p>
  <p>
    For now, this is just a placeholder so we can wire up routing and layout.
